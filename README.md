# Abiathar Online
A JavaScript level editor for Keen:Galaxy. Integrates with [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) for file storage.

## Hi
Hi! I'm Fleexy, creator of the [Abiathar](http://www.pckf.com/viewtopic.php?t=3023) level editor for Keen:Galaxy, Keen:Dreams, and a few other DOS games by ID Software. Abiathar is written in Visual Basic .NET, and as such isn't the most portable thing in the world. So I thought, "what's portable? JavaScript!" and so decided to attempt a JavaScript implementation of a K:G level editor. I've been hoping to learn JavaScript for some time now, and since the code is entirely client-side and plain-text, I might as well jump in to the whole open-source thing. And so I'm here on GitHub. (But don't expect me to install Linux any time soon.)

I've never written any JavaScript at all, so you get to watch me fumble around with this whole web scripting thing. I plan on using Visual Studio for the actual coding and Google Chrome for the use. (Although Internet Explorer has way better debugging tools. Wait, come back!) I've also never made serious use of source control before, so... hooray! Learning!

## License
I haven't chosen a license yet, but I can definitely tell you it won't be GPL. (But that's a rant for another time.) I'm seriously considering writing my own. Until then, this is just **Copyright (c) Ben Nordick 2015**.

Wondering what Keen is? [Check out the Public Commander Keen Forum](http://pckf.com) or the [Keen:Modding forum](http://keenmodding.org). I'm Fleexy in both of those places.
